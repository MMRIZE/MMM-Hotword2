# MMM-Hotword2
MagicMirror module with Picovoice's Porcupine for Hotword detector. My previous `MMM-Hotword` module is deprecated due to `snowboy` hot-word detecting engine closing its service. Fortunately, PICOVOICE's Porcupine and its siblings would be good enough alternative. So I rebuilt the hot-word detector again.

- Not only hotword, but also continuous utterance could be acauired.(as recorded wav file)
  - The recorded file could be consumed on other STT / voice handling modules
- No need to rebuild for electron
